A social network for facilitation of sharing, borrowing, and lending


Developers:

Make sure you never post our Amazon Secret Key into Github, strip it out and replace it with [Amazon Secret goes here] everytime.
Make sure files under MVC are all lowercase (Model, Controller, and View folders can have their first letter uppercase)

Users: 

No HTTPS TLS support planned in the near future, please use fake passwords you would never use and post only low-value items for lending
Do not meet with anyone outside of the UW network, and do try to meet in public places.
